# powerBI_Blinkit_Dashboard
Developed an end-to-end sales performance dashboard for Blinkit using Power BI to visualize and track key retail KPIs. The dashboard includes dynamic cards for Total Sales, Orders, and Profit, with calculated metrics like Profit Margin and Average Order Value.

Implemented interactive slicers for Date Range, Region, and Product Category to enable flexible filtering across visuals. Visual components include:

Bar & Column Charts for Sales and Profit by Region and Category

Line Chart for monthly Sales trends over time

Pie Chart showing country-wise sales contribution

KPI Cards highlighting current performance

Used DAX to create calculated columns and measures, and enhanced readability through clean layout, color-coded visuals, and tooltips. The dashboard empowers business stakeholders to monitor trends, identify high-performing regions/products, and make data-driven decisions to optimize revenue and operations.
